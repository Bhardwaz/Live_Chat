## Data Layer
## Get Data Live 
## Update the UI

You can send a message in live Chat as well
To Start the Project
```npm install```
and
``` npm start ```

### In Live Chat if we keep adding div or other tags. my page will freeze. so we have to update UI in efficient and giving the better experience to user

# Problems
### Taking the Live data and Updating the UI

## Talk about Data (Near Real Time Data)
### if the data is static we can call the API and then update the UI accordingly. Easy! 
### But when Data is Live. There are two ways we can handle this. 
### 1. Web Sockets - its a two way connection. its like a Handshake b/w server and UI. its bi-directiional live data means we can get and post data easily. For Example Trading apps, WhatsApp, Messangers

### 2. API Polling - Data Flows Server to UI. It has a regular Interval. We can do API Polling application like Gmail bcz it has regular interval and it is fine to implement these thing
